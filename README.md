# AdobeIllustratorScripts
Extendscript / Javascript extensions for Adobe Illustrator

These are my scripts for making Illustrator better, easier and more efficient. I use them via [Josh B. Duncan's](https://github.com/joshbduncan/AiCommandPalette/commits?author=joshbduncan) brilliant [Illustrator Command Palette](https://github.com/joshbduncan/AiCommandPalette). The best tool for Illustrator, and it's open and free! footnote[^1]

## Install
To install the scripts, just copy them to `/Applications/Adobe Illustrator/Scripting.localized` on Mac, or `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe lllustrator\Startup Scripts\` on Windows. For more information, see [Adobe's guide](https://ai-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/introduction/executingScripts.html).

## Use
To use the scripts, select them from File â†’ Scripts in Illustrator, or add them to the Command Palette with the command `Load Script(s)...`.
